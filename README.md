Hello John! 

I am going to try to map migrant deaths and disappearances which took place in 2015 in the Eastern Mediterranean (mostly off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea). This relates vaguely to some research I am hoping to do next semester, so I thought it would be useful to start to get a sense of what kind of data is available. 

The International Organization of Migration (IOM) tracks migrant deaths and has a downloadable csv that's reagularly updated. So far I have cleaned the IOM data and mapped the coordinates.

I also found some downloadable shapefiles of maritime borders that i will use.

I still need to figure out the best way to change the point size according to the number of individuals who died/disappeared in each event/point, and I'm hoping to find some good layers to lable the bodies of water and Greek Islands. 
THen I will make a static web, explain the data and where it came from, and make the website! 

Let me know what you think!
